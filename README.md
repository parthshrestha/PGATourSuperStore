## Introduction
<p>
    Welcome to the PGA Tour Superstore! This is a Java-Based Desktop Application that is used to represent an actual real life golf shop. The features of this application are pretty simple. We have a simulation that would allow data fill towards the store and allows users to simulate what it's like being around the store. Next Manager Mode, this mode allows users to interact with the store directly with a simple UI that uses Java FX. Simple go through each tab and you'll be able to utilize each functionality. Lastly, Virtual Map, this tab represents how employees would potentially pick up items around the store should there be an online order. It's intended to efficiently helps new employees go around the store much faster.
